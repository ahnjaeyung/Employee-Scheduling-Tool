## Installation  
Clone repo and npm i  
## Usage  
This application is deployed on heroku, and can be reached [here](https://shrouded-anchorage-20681.herokuapp.com/).  

To begin, the user must first log in.  If the user does not yet have an account, then they can click the sign up link at the bottom of the login page.  Once at the sign up page, the user can enter their email and password to create an account.  

Once a user is logged in, they can access the *form* page to enter an employee's first name, last name, and check the days that the employee will be unavailable to be scheduled.  When this information is submitted, it is added to the database of employee availabilities.

When the user visits the *availabilities* page, the user can view a table showing the scheduling period and all employees' availabilities during the scheduling period.
